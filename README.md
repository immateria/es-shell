# hesh — Higher-order Extensible SHell

hesh is an extensible Plan 9-inspired shell, rebooted with first-class functional and math features.

Based on Byron Rakitzis’s `rc` and Paul Haahr’s `es`, but rewritten for the modern shell hacker.  
Public domain, no restrictions.  

> hesh wants poppers. you want a modern rc.
