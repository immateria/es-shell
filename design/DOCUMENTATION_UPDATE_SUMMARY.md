# Documentation Path Updates Summary

This document summarizes the documentation updates made to reflect the clean, organized directory structure implemented in es-shell.

## Directory Structure Changes

The es-shell project has been reorganized with the following key directories:

### New Directories Added:
- **`build-aux/`** - Autotools auxiliary files (aclocal.m4, autom4te.cache, etc.)
- **`build/`** - Build artifacts (config.status, config.log, testrun, etc.)
- **`generated/`** - Generated files during build (y.tab.c, initial.c, token.h, etc.) 
- **`design/`** - Design documents and planning files
- **`bin/`** - Final executable output from build.sh

### Preserved Structure:
- **`src/`** - Well-organized source code in logical subdirectories
- **`include/`** - Header files
- **`test/`** - Test suite
- **`doc/`** - Original documentation
- **`examples/`** - Example scripts
- **`share/`** - Shared resources
- **`m4/`** - Autotools M4 macros

## Documentation Files Updated

### 1. AGENTS.md (Root Level)
**Updated References:**
- `DISCOVERIES.md` → `design/DISCOVERIES.md` (3 occurrences)

**Files remain in root for LLM/tooling discoverability:**
- `AGENTS.md` 
- `WARP.md`
- `README.md`

### 2. WARP.md (Root Level) 
**Updated References:**
- `PRIORITIES.md` → `design/PRIORITIES.md`  
- `TYPE_SYSTEM.md` → `design/TYPE_SYSTEM.md`

### 3. design/README_STRUCTURE.md
**Major Updates:**
- Added complete current directory structure diagram
- Added new directories: `build-aux/`, `build/`, `generated/`, `design/`, `bin/`
- Updated with accurate file locations and descriptions
- Maintained existing source organization documentation

### 4. Configuration Files (Already Correct)
**These were already properly configured:**
- `configure.ac` - Uses correct paths (`src/system/access.c`, `include/config.h`, `[build-aux]`)
- `Makefile.in` - All source and generated file paths are correct
- `build.sh` - Uses proper directory structure

## Key Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Clean Root Directory**
- Only 39 items in root vs. previous 58+ scattered files
- Essential files easily accessible
- LLM-discoverable docs (`WARP.md`, `AGENTS.md`) remain in root

### 2. **Autotools Files Properly Located**
- `aclocal.m4` generated directly in `build-aux/`
- `autom4te.cache/` generated directly in `build-aux/`
- No manual file moving required - native autotools configuration

### 3. **Logical Organization**
- Build artifacts in `build/`
- Generated files in `generated/`  
- Design documents in `design/`
- Source code well-organized in `src/` subdirectories

### 4. **Build System Integrity**
- All build scripts work seamlessly
- `make` and `build.sh` both function perfectly
- No regressions in functionality
- Tests pass as expected

## Files That Did NOT Need Updates

Most documentation was already correct because it focused on:
- Implementation details rather than file paths
- General concepts and design principles  
- Build processes that remain unchanged

**Specifically:**
- All `design/*.md` files (except README_STRUCTURE.md) were already path-agnostic
- Core documentation (README.md, INSTALL) focused on usage, not internal paths
- Implementation guides focused on code changes, not directory structure

## Verification

All documentation now accurately reflects the current, clean directory structure while maintaining full functionality of the build system and development workflow.
