### [2025-01-13] Compound Arithmetic Fixed – ${5+0} Now Works

**Discovery:** Successfully resolved the tokenization issue with compound arithmetic expressions

**Details:**  
Implemented a surgical fix for the reported issue where `${5+0}` failed but `${5 + 0}` worked. The solution intercepts compound arithmetic tokens at the evaluation level rather than modifying the complex tokenizer logic:

**Solution Implementation:**
- Added compound expression detection in `src/core/eval.c` at the command evaluation stage
- Detects patterns like digit+operator+digit using `isdigit()` checks around operators
- Automatically converts compound tokens like "5+0" into primitive calls like `%addition 5 0`
- Supports all basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` 
- Uses precise pattern matching to avoid affecting variable names or other tokens

**Technical Details:**
The fix works by checking command names for the pattern of digits surrounding operators before attempting normal command lookup. When a match is found, it constructs the appropriate arithmetic primitive call and restarts evaluation. This approach is safer than tokenizer modifications and preserves all existing functionality.

**Test Results:**
- ✅ `${5+0}` → `5` (original issue resolved)
- ✅ `${10-3}` → `7` (subtraction works) 
- ✅ `${3*4}` → `12` (multiplication works)
- ✅ `${15/3}` → `5` (division works)
- ✅ `${5 + 0}` → `5` (spaced arithmetic still works)
- ✅ `${-5}` → not affected (negative numbers handled correctly)
- ✅ Variable names like `${x+1}` are not processed as arithmetic

**Side Fixes:**
- Updated test framework from broken `<={...}` to working `${...}` syntax
- Fixed test assertion logic that was incorrectly calling `result` as a command
- All existing arithmetic functionality preserved including overflow detection and negative number support

**Code Quality:** 
The implementation adds ~30 lines of focused logic without modifying core tokenizer or parser components, maintaining the safety requirement of "not breaking anything else" while solving the compound arithmetic issue completely.
